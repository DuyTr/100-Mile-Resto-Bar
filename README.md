# 100 Mile Resto Bar Webite

### Description:

 RED Academy Project 2 - A one-page, responsive website for non-existent 100 Mile Resto Bar.
 
 * Dynamic opening/close display based on day of the week
 * Single page smooth scrooling effect
 * Image slider
 * Date and time picker for reservation
 
### Stuff used to make this:

 * HTML/CSS
 * JavaScript, JQuery
 * BXSlider, TimePicker, Datepicker JQuery Plugins
 * Flexbox
 * Responsive web design

##### My thought on the project :+1: :
A project that helps me to understand JavaScript and JQuery. I get confortable implementing JQuery plugins and stlying them using CSS (BXSlider, Timepicker and datepicker plugins).
